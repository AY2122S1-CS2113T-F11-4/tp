* **Data structure**: Constructed the data structure model that was used in all features.
  * What it does: The model classes provides all the necessary methods that are required to implement all functionalities in this application.
  * 
* **New Feature**: Storage
  * What it does: Automatically saves all changes to a local JSON file after the execution of any command. It also manages the loading of data from the same JSON file to the application when the application is opened.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user no longer need to keep the application on forever to keep the application remember all the information. The user can also easily keep a snapshot of the data as backup at any time and no longer worry about any significant data loss.
  * Highlights: This enhancement does not affect any existing functionalities.
  * Credits: [org.json](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) was used as JSON builder and JSON parser.
